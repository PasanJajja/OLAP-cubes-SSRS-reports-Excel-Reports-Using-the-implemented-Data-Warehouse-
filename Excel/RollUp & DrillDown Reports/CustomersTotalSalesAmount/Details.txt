In this excel sheet it shows the total sales amount and the total profit using the kpi value
of the customers.
In the coloumns I have included a hierarchy (Region-->State/Province-->City-->Customers)
which is a un-natural hierarchy in this case 
so I can view the report details region wise state wise city wise customer details.

for my row also... From year we can drill down to months so we can view the monthly
sales amount and the profit details..
Again we can Roll up from months to years so we can view the yearly sales amount and the 
profit.
